## Abstract
When neural networks trained on data to solve one problem are trained onnew data to solve another problem they tend to forget the previous knowl-edge they had that was needed to solve the first problem. This phenomenonis called CI. This thesis compares two state-of-the-art algorithms for reducingCatastrophic Interference (CI) in Neural Networks, specifically IncrementalMoment Matching-Mean (IMM-Mean) and Hard Attention to the Task (HAT).Images from three different datasets with increasing complexity, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, are used to train and test their performances. Thealgorithms are trained on data from each respective dataset, partitioned intosubsets, structured so that new classes of data are introduced with each newproblem the algorithms are trained on, an approach known as IncrementalClass Learning (ICL). From our results, we concluded that HAT suffers sig-nificantly less CI than IMM. Future work should however explore whether thisis the case when changing some of the parameters used for the thesis.

## Installing
The software setup follows the recommendations from the repository on which the code for this thesis is based. Specifically, using PyTorch as the framework and a Conda virtual environment running Python 3.6.8 with additional required packages installed.
